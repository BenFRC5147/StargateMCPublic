## Locations file
## If using NPC, the NPC must have a unique name in the registry. This is a limitation in the code.... but is by design.
## The reason for this is that If the NPCs name isnt unique, the SRPG plugin must locate all players within 10 blocks of every npc that matches and this will cause lag.
locations:
    1:
        #True or false, is the location name an NPC name?
        npc: true
        #If NPC is false, what are the coordinates for this locaction?
        x: 29
        y: 79
        z: 90
        # World the location is on. Does not apply to NPCs.
        world: Lacun
        # Name of the NPC. Must be unique in the NPC Registry... across all worlds.
        name: Constantine
